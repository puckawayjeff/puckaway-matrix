# PHP-generated camera stills with overlays
This takes still image output from compatible IP webcams, handles camera 
authentication, adds overlay information (including data from external sensors), 
can resize and stitch multiple images into one collage, and spits them out as 
regular JPEG files accessible from clean .jpg URLs.
